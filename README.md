# üåê TechCon 2024 Website

## Project Overview
This repository contains the source code for the TechCon 2024 conference website. This project was developed as a comprehensive exercise to practice fundamental **HTML5 semantic structure**, navigation, tables, forms, and multimedia embedding.

The website is a static, multi-page site, simulating a real-world conference presence.

## üìÅ File Structure

The project consists of five core, linked HTML pages:

| File Name | Description | Key HTML Concept |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`index.html`** | The main landing page and introduction to the conference. | Semantic Structure (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`) |
| **`about.html`** | Details on the conference history, mission, and featured speakers. | Headings (`<h1>`-`<h6>`) and Text (`<p>`) |
| **`schedule.html`** | A detailed timetable of all sessions and events. | **Tables** (`<table>`, `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`) |
| **`register.html`** | A user-friendly form for attendees to sign up for the conference. | **Forms** (`<form>`, `<input>`, `type="email"`, `type="checkbox"`, etc.) |
| **`contact.html`** | Contact information, social links, an embedded map, and a contact form. | **Multimedia** (`<iframe>` for map, `<video>`) and `mailto:` links |

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Complete Semantic Structure:** Utilizes modern HTML5 elements (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`) for accessibility and structure.
* **Clear Navigation:** A consistent navigation bar is present on all five pages for seamless user experience.
* **Responsive Data Display:** The schedule is presented using an accessible HTML table.
* **Interactive Forms:** Includes both a registration form and a "Contact Us" form.
* **Multimedia Integration:** Showcases embedded content, including a video and an interactive map.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to View

1.  **Clone the Repository:** Download or clone this repository to your local machine.

## üíª How to Write a `README.md` in Visual Studio Code

Writing and formatting a README file is easy in VS Code because it has built-in support for **Markdown**.

### Step 1: Create the File

1.  Open your project folder (e.g., `TechCon_Website`) in **VS Code**.
2.  In the File Explorer (the sidebar on the left), click the **New File** icon at the top. 
3.  Type the exact name **`README.md`** and press Enter. (The file is automatically created in the root of your project.)

### Step 2: Add Content and Use Markdown

1.  Paste the content provided above into the new `README.md` file.
2.  **Markdown** is a simple plain-text language that uses special characters to apply formatting:
    * `# Heading 1` becomes the largest title.
    * `## Heading 2` becomes a main subtitle.
    * `**bold text**` makes the text **bold**.
    * `| column | column |` creates tables.

### Step 3: Use the Preview Feature

VS Code allows you to see exactly how your Markdown will look before you commit it to GitHub:

1.  Make sure the `README.md` file is open and active in the editor.
2.  Look in the top-right corner of the editor window for the **Markdown Preview** icon (it looks like a small sheet of paper with a magnifying glass). 
3.  Click the icon, and a second pane will open showing the formatted, final look of your README. This lets you check your tables, headings, and bold text easily!
